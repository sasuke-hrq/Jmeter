Software Testing Technology lab6 in TJU about Jmeter.


Using zentao because the bugfree has stopped updating.
When running code on the virtual machine, it crashed directly.
So when executing the second stress test, the modification test was deleted and the result was barely found.

It gets stuck at a few clicks and needs to be restarted,which makes me crash just like the virtual machine.
Please refer to the process of running code and praying for blessings for details:https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UB4y1U7ZE?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0
